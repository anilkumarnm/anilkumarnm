# 👋  Hi, I’m Anilkumar

I design and lead the development of large-scale infrastructure and platform systems that enable organizations to operate reliably while moving fast at scale.

My work spans Platform Engineering, Site Reliability Engineering, DevOps, Infrastructure as Code, distributed orchestration, and resilience engineering. I focus on building platforms and operating models that reduce organizational friction, standardize execution, and compound engineering leverage across teams.

Earlier in my career, I worked deeply in network and cloud security. That foundation strongly shapes how I design platforms today: security is part of the system model, failure is expected, and production reality always wins over theory.

## Impact at Scale

Most of my work is focused on systems that change how organizations operate, not just how individual services run. I’ve led platform and orchestration initiatives that reduced complex delivery timelines from months to weeks by standardizing execution and ownership across dozens of teams, while significantly lowering operational load through automation and guardrails. Much of this work involved aligning senior engineers and platform teams on shared abstractions, execution models, and long-term ownership.

These systems are designed to evolve, support independent team velocity, and remain reliable under real production stress.

### Scope of Work
  
  - Defining and evolving internal developer platforms (IDPs) used by multiple teams, including paved roads for infrastructure and application delivery
  - Establishing self-service infrastructure models with clear ownership, guardrails, strong governance, and safety boundaries
  - Driving reliability-first, failure-aware system design across platforms to prevent incidents through abstraction, standardization, and automation
  - Designing and scaling CI/CD systems across teams, environments, and regions, including promotion, rollout, rollback, and environment isolation strategies
  - Architecting Infrastructure as Code platforms with drift detection, lifecycle management, and reproducibility for large-scale, multi-account environments
  - Designing and operating orchestration-driven platforms that coordinate complex execution flows, dependencies, retries, and long-running workflows
  - Building and validating automated, multi-region disaster recovery systems and recovery workflows
  - Actively applying AI-assisted automation to platform engineering, orchestration, and infrastructure operations to reduce manual effort and improve decision-making

### Networking, Security & Reliability Foundation

Earlier in my career, I worked deeply in network and cloud security, including:
  - Enterprise firewall deployments
  - Virtualized and Containerized PAN firewalls (AWS, Azure, VMware, KVM)
  - Authentication systems, VPNs, and secure connectivity
  - Incident response and deep root cause analysis

### How I Think About Systems

  - Optimize for organizational leverage over local optimization
  - Design platforms that make the safe and scalable path the default
  - Prefer explicit execution and ownership models over implicit behavior
  - Assume failure is normal and design systems that degrade predictably
  - Build platforms and operating models that can evolve without rewrites

## 🔭 Areas of Ongoing Interest

  - Platform orchestration and execution models at organizational scale
  - Workflow engines and execution semantics for complex systems
  - Reliability and resilience in large-scale distributed systems
  - AI-assisted infrastructure, operations, and decision support
  - Scalable DevOps and platform operating models
